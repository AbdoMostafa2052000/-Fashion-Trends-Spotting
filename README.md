### Introduction
Social media platforms are rich sources of customer feedback and opinions. By analyzing the comments on influencers' pages, we can gain insights into customer preferences and demands in the fashion industry. This project aims to leverage sentiment analysis to predict these preferences and help fashion brands make data-driven decisions.

### Project Objectives
- To collect data from social media influencers’ pages.
- To preprocess and clean the collected data.
- To perform sentiment analysis on the comments.
- To build a prediction model that forecasts customer preferences and demands.

### Methodology

#### Data Collection
We utilize web scraping techniques to gather data from various social media platforms. The focus is on influencers in the fashion industry, extracting information about fashion items and the corresponding comments.

#### Data Processing
The raw data collected is processed to remove noise and irrelevant information. This involves cleaning the text, handling missing values, and preparing the data for sentiment analysis.

#### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is performed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral to understand the overall sentiment towards different fashion items.
